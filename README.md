## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral researcher exploring plant metabolism, biosynergists, and high-throughput biological data pipelines

## About Me
-  Experienced in large-scale data analysis using HPC environments such as Compute Canada servers  
-  Passionate about integrating bioinformatics, molecular biology, and structural biology tools to design data-driven solutions in agriculture and biotechnology sector

## Skills
- **Transcriptomics:** Reference and de novo assembly, differential gene expression, functional annotation and pathway analysis  
- **Genomics and Population Genetics:** Assembly, scaffolding and gap filling, Variant calling, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and population structure analysis  
- **Proteomics and Structural Biology:** Highthrougput protein analysis including HDX-MS data analysis, fluorescence-based assays and biochemical activity measurements, molecular     docking and protein structure prediction  
- **Phylogenetics and Sequence Analysis:** Multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction and domain identification
- **Data Visualization (R):** Automated visualization pipelines for large-scale datasets. Custom plots for transcriptomics, proteomics, and biochemical assays using ggplot2,          ComplexHeatmap and pheatmap
- **Bioinformatics Pipelines and HPC:** Parallelized workflows, multi-omics integration and large-scale data mining
